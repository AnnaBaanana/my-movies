# My Movies Project

## About the Project:
This project allows you to browse a collection of *my* movie recommendations, serach them by movie name, add new movies to the collection as well as edit the existing ones.


## This project was completed with the the following goals in mind: 
 - Create a react app with 5 components or more
 - Use react-router-dom to set up 3 or more routes, linked components, and programmatic navigation
 - Persist data using a json server
 - Incorporate bootstrap for styling

## Getting Started:
- Clone the repository [git@github.com:your-name/my-movies.git]
- run ### `npm install`
- run ### `npm start` to start the app server
- run ### `npm run server` to start the json server

## Usage:
Keep this app handy to keep track of your favorite movies (especially if you are like me that always forgets what their favorite movie is when asked) and share with your friends to keep expanding the collection!
